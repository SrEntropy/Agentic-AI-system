# Agentic-AI-system
## objective:
 - a smart system that enables efficient and accurate PoC reports.
 - Each agent is an expert in a specific domain of the system cycle.
 - Different LLMs and classifiers are involved.
 - 
## This system is at an early stage:
- Recon, Analyzer, and Knowledge Agent.
- Define tasks of each agent before scaling.

# Disclaimer:
- No security is integrated yet, as agents do not have a defined expertise domain.
- Running this code at an early stage can introduce breaches and unpredictable behaviors of agents.
